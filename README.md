## End-To-End-Provenance

Provenance is the history of an item of data from its creation to its present state. It includes details about the steps that were executed and the intermediate values that were created in order to produce the data in its current form. For scientists, provenance can help to facilitate reproduction and validation of scientific results. But in most computer systems today, provenance is an after-thought, implemented as an auxiliary indexing structure that parallels the actual data. Our goal in this project is to design, build, and study an end-to-end system that extends all the way from original data analyses by real scientists to management and analysis of the resulting provenance in a common framework with common tools.

## Software Tools

* [R Tools](https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/End-to-end-provenance.github.io/blob/master/RTools.md): Provenance tools for the R statistical language
* [Extended Prov-JSON](https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ExtendedProvJson/blob/master/README.md): An extension of the W3C PROV-JSON standard for fine-grained provenance
